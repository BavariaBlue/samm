# Executive Summary

The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organizations formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks facing the organization. The resources provided by SAMM will aid in:

✦ Evaluating an organization’s existing software security practices.

✦ Building a balanced software security assurance program in well-defined iterations.

✦ Demonstrating concrete improvements to a security assurance program.

✦ Defining and measuring security-related activities throughout an organization.

Version 1.1 of SAMM expanded and restructured its predecessor into four complementary resources: this document that describes the core SAMM model, the How-To Guide that explains how to apply the model, the Quick Start Guide to help accelerate learning and adoption, and the toolbox that provides simple automation for data collection, metrics, and graphs. Furthermore, a number of elements have been renamed to better represent their purpose.

Version 1.5 of SAMM incorporates a refinement of the scoring model to provide more granularity to the scoring in an assessment. Now an organization will get credit for all the related work done in a practice rather than having the base number held at the highest completed maturity level. The updated scoring model has been designed to help SAMM assessors and organizations avoid the awkward discussion on whether to mark an answer yes or no when it is honestly something in between, and to show incremental improvements.

SAMM was defined with flexibility in mind such that it can be utilized by small, medium, and large organizations using any style of development. Additionally, this model can be applied organization-wide, for a single line-of-business, or even for an individual project. Beyond these traits, SAMM was built on the following principles:

✦ An organization’s behavior changes slowly over time - A successful software security program should be specified in small iterations that deliver tangible assurance gains while incrementally working toward long-term goals.

✦ There is no single recipe that works for all organizations - A software security framework must be flexible and allow organizations to tailor their choices based on their risk tolerance and the way in which they build and use software.

✦ Guidance related to security activities must be prescriptive - All the steps in building and assessing an assurance program should be simple, well-defined, and measurable. This model also provides roadmap templates for common types of organizations.

The foundation of the model is built upon the core business functions of software development with security practices tied to each (see diagram below). The building blocks of the model are the three maturity levels defined for each of the twelve security practices. These define a wide variety of activities in which an organization could engage to reduce security risks and increase software assurance. Additional details are included to measure successful activity performance, understand the associated assurance benefits, estimate personnel and other costs.

As an open project, SAMM content shall always remain vendor-neutral and freely available for all to use.

######SAMM is built upon a collection of security practices that are tied back into the core business functions involved in software development. This section introduces those business functions and the corresponding security practices for each. After covering the high-level framework, the maturity levels for each security practice are also discussed briefly in order to paint a picture of how each can be iteratively improved over time.

# Business Functions

**At the highest level, SAMM defines four critical business functions.** Each business function is a category of activities related to the nuts-and-bolts of software development, or stated another way, any organization involved with software development must fulfill each of these business functions to some degree.

**For each business function, SAMM defines three security practices.** Each security practice is an area of security-related activities that build assurance for the related business function. There are twelve security practices that are the independent silos for improvement that map to the four business functions of software development.

**For each security practice, SAMM defines three maturity levels as objectives.** Each level within a security practice is characterized by a successively more sophisticated objective defined by specific activities, and more stringent success metrics than the previous level. Additionally, each security practice can be improved independently, though related activities can lead to optimizations.

## Governance

Governance is centered on the processes and activities related to how an organization manages overall software development activities. More specifically, this includes concerns that impact cross-functional groups involved in development, as well as business processes that are established at the organization level.

**Strategy & Metrics** involves the overall strategic direction of the software assurance program and instrumentation of processes and activities to collect metrics about an or- ganization’s security posture.

**Policy & Compliance** involves setting up a security, compliance, and audit control framework throughout an organization to achieve increased assurance in software under contruction and in operation.

**Lifecycle Security Culture** add short description here.

## Construction:

Construction concerns the processes and activities related to how an organization defines goals and creates software within development projects. In general, this will include product management, requirements gathering, high-level architecture specification, detailed design, and implementation.

**Threat Assessment** involves accurately identifying and characterizing potential attacks upon an organization’s software in order to better understand the risks and facilitate risk management.

**Security Requirements** involves promoting the inclusion of security-related requirements during the software development process in order to specify correct functional-ity from inception.

**Secure Architecture** involves bolstering the design process with activities to promote secure-by-default designs and control over technologies and frameworks upon which software is built.

**Lifecycle Security Design** involves planning and setting up of penetration tests and test environment.

…_more on page 12_

## Verification

Verification is focused on the processes and activities related to how an organization checks, and tests artifacts produced throughout software development. This typically includes quality assurance work such as testing, but it can also include other review and evaluation activities.

**Design Review** involves inspection of the artifacts created from the design process to ensure provision of adequate security mechanisms, and adherence to an organization’s expectations for security.

**Implementation Review** involves assessment of an organization’s source code to aid vulnerability discovery and related mitigation activities as well as establish a baseline for secure coding expectations.

**Security Testing** involves testing the organization’s software in its runtime environment, in order to both discover vulnerabilities, and establish a minimum standard for software releases.

**Lifecycle Security Testing** add short description here.

…_more on page 14_

## Operations

Operations entails the processes and activities related to how an organization manages software releases that has been created. This can involve shipping products to end users, deploying products to internal or external hosts, and normal operations of software in the runtime environment.

**Issue Management** involves establishing consistent processes for managing internal and external vulnerability reports to limit exposure and gather data to enhance the security assurance program.

**Environment Hardening** involves implementing controls for the operating environment surrounding an organization’s software to bolster the security posture of applications that have been deployed.

**Operational Enablement** involves identifying and capturing security-relevant information needed by an operator to properly configure, deploy, and run an organization’s software.

**Lifecycle Security Monitoring** add short description here.

### Maturity Levels

Each of the twelve security practices has three defined maturity levels and an implicit starting point at zero. The details for each level differs between the practices, but they generally represent:

- 0. Implicit starting point representing the activities in the practice being unfulfilled
- 1. Initial understanding and adhoc provision of security practice
- 2. Increase efficiency and/or effectiveness of the security practice
- 3. Comprehensive mastery of the security practice at scale

Assurance programs might not always consist of activities that neatly fall on a boundary between maturity levels, e.g. an organization that assesses to a Level 1 for a given practice might also have additional activities in place but not such that Level 2 is completed. Prior to v1.5, the organization’s score should be annotated with a “**+**” symbol to indicate there’s additional assurances in place beyond those indicated by the Level obtained. For example, an organization that is performing all Level 1 activities for operational enablement as well as one Level 2 or 3 activity would be assigned a “**1+**” score. Likewise, an organization performing all activities for a security practice, including some beyond the scope of SAMM, would be given a "**3+**" score.

The scoring model has changed in v1.5 to provide more granularity to the scoring in an assessment. Now an organization will get credit for different levels of work they have done within a practice rather than having the base number held at the highest completed maturity level. The scoring is now fractional to two decimal places for each practice and a single decimal for an answer. Questions have also been changed from Yes/No to four options that represent different levels of coverage or maturity. This change will assist practitioners completing SAMM assessments with the inevitable debate whether to mark an answer yes or no when it is honestly something in between.

The primary reason for the scoring change was to ensure organizations would receive full credit for their work in software security and to make it easier to show improvements in scoring when activities and programs grow and mature. The hope is this change will bring us closer to understanding what works in different scenarios for different organizations to benefit all.

The toolbox spreadsheet has been updated to reflect more context aware answers for each of the questions in the assessment. The formulas in the toolbox will also average the answers to calculate the score for each practice, a roll up average for each business function, and an overall score. The toolbox also has updated scorecard graphics that help represent the current score and can help show improvements to the program as the answers to the questions change. The worksheets later in this document are also updated to align with the new scoring model.

- **No = 0**
- **Few/Some = .2**
- **At Least Half = .5**
- **Many/Most = 1**

## Description of Security Practices

### Strategy & Metrics

The Strategy & Metrics (SM) practice is focused on establishing the framework within an organization for a software security assurance program. This is the most fundamental step in defining security goals in a way that’s both measurable and aligned with the organization’s real business risk.

By starting with lightweight risk profiles, an organization grows into more advanced risk classification schemes for application and data assets over time. With additional insight on relative risk measures, an organization can tune its project-level security goals and develop granular roadmaps to make the security program more efficient. At the more advanced levels within this practice, an organization draws upon many data sources, both internal and external, to collect metrics and qualitative feedback on the security program. This allows fine tuning of cost outlay versus the realized benefit at the program level.

### Policy & Compliance

The Policy & Compliance (PC) practice is focused on understanding and meeting external legal and regulatory requirements while also driving internal security standards to ensure compliance in a way that’s aligned with the business purpose of the organization.

A driving theme for improvement within this practice is focus on project-level audits that gather information about the organization’s behavior in order to check that expectations are being met. By introducing routine audits that start out lightweight and grow in depth over time, organizational change is achieved iteratively.

In a sophisticated form, provision of this practice entails organization-wide understanding of both internal standards and external compliance drivers while also maintaining low-latency checkpoints with project teams to ensure no project is operating outside expectations without visibility.

### Education & Guidance

The Education & Guidance (EG) practice is focused on arming personnel involved in the software lifecycle with knowledge and resources to design, develop, and deploy secure software. With improved access to information, project teams will be better able to proactively identify and mitigate specific security risks that apply to their organization.

One major theme for improvement across the objectives is providing training for employees, either through instructor-led sessions or computer-based modules. As an organization progresses, a broad base of training is built by starting with developers and moving to other roles throughout the organization, culminating with the addition of role-based certification to ensure comprehension of the material.

In addition to training, this practice also requires pulling security-relevant information into guidelines that serve as reference information to staff. This builds a foundation for establishing a baseline expectation for security practices in your organization, and later allows for incremental improvement once usage of the guidelines has been adopted.

## Description of Security Practices

### Threat Assessment

The Threat Assessment (TA) practice is centered on identification and understanding the project-level risks based on the functionality of the software being developed and characteristics of the runtime environment. From details about threats and likely attacks against each project, the organization as a whole operates more effectively through better decisions about prioritization of initiatives for security. Additionally, decisions for risk acceptance are more informed, therefore better aligned to the business.

By starting with simple threat models and building to more detailed methods of threat analysis and weighting, an organization improves over time. Ultimately, a sophisticated organization would maintain this information in a way that is tightly coupled to the compensating factors and pass-through risks from external entities. This provides greater breadth of understanding for potential downstream impacts from security issues while keeping a close watch on the organization’s current performance against known threats.

### Security Requirements

The Security Requirements (SR) practice is focused on proactively specifying the expected behavior of software with respect to security. Through addition of analysis activities at the project level, security requirements are initially gathered based on the high-level business purpose of the software. As an orga-nization advances, more advanced techniques are used such as access control specifications to discover new security requirements that may not have been initially obvious to development.

In a sophisticated form, provision of this practice also entails pushing the security requirements of the organization into its relationships with suppliers and then auditing projects to ensure all are adhering to expectations with regard to specification of security requirements.

### Secure Architecture

The Secure Architecture (SA) practice is focused on proactive steps for an organization to design and build secure software by default. By enhancing the software design process with reusable services and components, the overall security risk from software development can be dramatically reduced.

Beginning from simple recommendations about software frameworks and explicit consideration of secure design principles, an organization evolves toward consistently using design patterns for security functionality. Also, activities encourage project teams to increased utilization of centralized security services and infrastructure.

As an organization evolves over time, sophisticated provision of this practice entails organizations building reference platforms to cover the generic types of software they build. These serve as frameworks upon which developers can build custom software with lower risk of vulnerabilities.

### Lifecycle Security Design

The Lifecycle Security Design (LSD) method focuses on proactive planning of penetration tests and its test environment on project level. The analysis of security risks and potential attacks during development ensures purposefully testing. A verification of implications on robustness against attacks and reliability is especially important. Furthermore, planning of legal principles for security/safety will be integrated and complemented by evaluations of executed penetration tests, which will lead on to iterative development cycles. While most of tests are completed during roll out, the LSD requires further planning for ongoing tests to test products against new occurring threats. Ongoing auditing and testing steadily expands the company's knowledge. Tools for hardware independent testing, which enables partial automation to simplify the process, can be developed due to diligent planning and knowledge acquisition.

## Description of Security Practices

### Design Review

The Design Review (DR) practice is focused on assessment of software design and architecture for security-related problems. This allows an organization to detect architecture-level issues early in software development and thereby avoid potentially large costs from refactoring later due to security concerns.

Beginning with lightweight activities to build understanding of the security-relevant details about an architecture, an organization evolves toward more formal inspection methods that verify completeness in provision of security mechanisms. At the organization level, design review services are built and offered to stakeholders.

In a sophisticated form, provision of this practice involves detailed, data-level inspection of designs, and enforcement of baseline expectations for conducting design assessments and reviewing findings before releases are accepted.

### Implementation Review

The Implementation Review (IR) practice is focused on inspection of software at the source code and configuration level in order to find security vulnerabilities. Code-level vulnerabilities are generally simple to understand conceptually, but even informed developers can easily make mistakes that leave software open to potential compromise.

To begin, an organization uses lightweight checklists and for efficiency, only inspects the most critical software modules. However, as an organization evolves it uses automation technology to dramatically improve coverage and efficacy of implementation review activities.

Sophisticated provision of this practice involves deeper integration of implementation review into the development process to enable project teams to find problems earlier. This also enables organizations to better audit and set expectations for implementation review findings before releases can be made.

### Security Testing

The Security Testing (ST) practice is focused on inspection of software in the runtime environment in order to find security problems. These testing activities bolster the assurance case for software by checking it in the same context in which it is expected to run, thus making visible operational misconfigurations or errors in business logic that are difficult to otherwise find.

Starting with penetration testing and high-level test cases based on the functionality of software, an organization evolves toward usage of security testing automation to cover the wide variety of test cases that might demonstrate a vulnerability in the system.

In an advanced form, provision of this practice involves customization of testing automation to build a battery of security tests covering application-specific concerns in detail. With additional visibility at the organization level, security testing enables organizations to set minimum expectations for security testing results before a project release is accepted.

# Operations

## Description of Security Practices

### Issue Management

The Issue Management (IM) practice is focused on the processes within an organization with respect to handling issue reports and operational incidents. By having these processes in place, an organization’s projects will have consistent expectations and increased efficiency for handling these events, rather than chaotic and uninformed responses.

Starting from lightweight assignment of roles in the event of an incident, an organization grows into a more formal incident response process that ensures visibility and tracking on issues that occur. Communications are also improved to improve overall understanding of the processes.

In an advanced form, issue management involves thorough dissecting of incidents and issue reports to collect detailed metrics and other root-cause information to feedback into the organization’s downstream behavior.

### Environment Hardening

The Environment Hardening (EH) practice is focused on building assurance for the runtime environment that hosts the organization’s software. Since secure operation of an application can be deteriorated by problems in external components, hardening this underlying infrastructure directly improves the overall security posture of the software.

By starting with simple tracking and distributing of information about the operating environment to keep development teams better informed, an organization evolves to scalable methods for managing deployment of security patches and instrumenting the operating environment with early-warning de- tectors for potential security issues before damage is done.

As an organization advances, the operating environment is further reviewed and hardened by deployment of protection tools to add layers of defenses and safety nets to limit damage in case any vulnerabilities are exploited.

### Operational Enablement

The Operational Enablement (OE) practice is focused on gathering security critical information from the project teams building software and communicating it to the users and operators of the software. Without this information, even the most securely designed software carries undue risks since important security characteristics and choices will not be known at a deployment site.

Starting from lightweight documentation to capture the most important details for users and operators, an organization evolves toward building complete operational security guides that are delivered with each release.

In an advanced form, operational enablement also entails organization-level checks against individual project teams to ensure that information is being captured and shared according to expectations.
